# Spotify Album Game

  
The Spotify Album Bracket project transforms music listening into a personalised game by 
integrating with Spotify. Players can engage with New Release Albums and their saved albums in a tournament 
style game, promoting the exploration of music and albums. Initially, we researched existing game concepts 
to enhance our design. Future updates may allow multiplayer options, shared brackets, and genre-based gameplay.
